# Email_Fetcher
Application for saving unread mails into database


🚀 Project Spotlight: Email Fetching Java Application 🚀

Excited to share a recent project I worked on: a Java-based Email Fetching Application! 📨

🔑 Project Overview
The application automatically captures unread emails from an email server (like Gmail or GoDaddy) and stores the email details in a database. This was achieved by combining the power of JavaMail API for email interaction and JDBC for database connectivity. The project is packaged as a JAR file and takes a configuration file as an argument, making it flexible and portable.

⚙️ Key Features
Properties-Driven Configuration: Credentials (such as email server details and database connection) are provided via a config.properties file, keeping the application secure and configurable without hardcoded values.
Unread Email Fetching: The application connects to an IMAP server, fetches unread emails, and processes their content, subject, and sender.
Database Integration: Email details are stored in a MySQL database for further analysis or reference.
Error Handling and Timeout Management: Proper error handling for invalid credentials, timeouts, and network issues.
💻 Technologies Used
JavaMail API for interacting with email servers via IMAP.
JDBC for interacting with a MySQL database.
Java Properties for flexible configuration and environment setup.
Database: MySQL for storing email details (subject, sender, body).
🛠️ Development Highlights
Implemented a fetchUnreadEmails() method that connects to the email server, retrieves unread messages, and saves them into the database.
Configured IMAP SSL settings and handled authentication with both regular passwords and app-specific passwords for enhanced security (especially with services like Gmail).
Deployment: Packaged the project into a runnable JAR file that accepts the properties file as an argument, enabling easy deployment across different environments.
💡 Use Cases
Email Archiving: Automatically save incoming emails for audit trails.
CRM Integration: Can be integrated into a customer relationship management (CRM) system to track and manage client interactions.
Data Analysis: Utilize the stored emails for sentiment analysis or reporting purposes.
This project was a great learning experience in handling email servers securely, managing connections, and ensuring proper data persistence!
